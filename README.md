This project was initiated as the result of an archival project I took on at my parents house.  My parents were getting ready to move from the home I grew up in to a smaller home, and as a result a lot of items had to be done away with.  We had a LOT of photos that no one ever looked at except very rare occasions; usually by accidentally coming across them, leafing through, then moving them someplace else to be happily stumbled upon in another few years.

To preserve the memories and sentimental value, but eliminate the phsical storage issue, I bought and EPSON ES-500W feed scanner and scanned everything.  Then I found a few more boxes, this time with photos from my grandparents era.  Then I found my biological grandfather's photo album of his 1950s military service... and so on, and so on.  Eventually I had well over 60GB purely of photos, most of which were uncategorized or unlabled -- usually both.  In order to introduce some labeling and order into this mass of data, I decided to kick off a facial recognition project.  

The goal of this product is to recognize faces.  Eventually, in a different project, I will *do* something with that information, but that is a seperate task (or set of tasks) for a future date. 

1) Detect faces in images
2) Detect *the same face* across a variety of images.
