# Motivation
This project was initiated as the result of an archival project I took on at my parents house.  My parents were getting ready to move from the home I grew up in to a smaller home, and as a result a lot of items had to be done away with.  We had a LOT of photos that no one ever looked at except very rare occasions; usually by accidentally coming across them, leafing through, then moving them someplace else to be happily stumbled upon in another few years.

To preserve the memories and sentimental value, but eliminate the physical storage issue, I bought an EPSON ES-500W feed scanner and scanned everything.  Then I found a few more boxes, this time with photos from my grandparents era.  Then I found my biological grandfather's photo album of his 1950s military service... and so on, and so on.  Eventually I had well over 60GB purely of photos, most of which were uncategorized or unlabled -- usually both.  In order to introduce some labeling and order into this mass of data, I decided to kick off a facial detection project.


# Data Used
I chose to use the Flicker-Faces-HQ Dataset for this project due to the size of the dataset (19GB and 52,000 faces) as well as its Public Domain Creative Common License, allowing me to use the project for commercial purposes down the road.
